# README: Audible for humans


-Created an site to be able to record "audibles" files straight from the sight and upload them.
-you can also review the "Audibles" that you can record.
-I used a ruby, rails backend --api, and with active storage for media handeling
-I'm using a react, javascript for frontend
-used hooks, with axios calls
-using a "micRecorder" npm to get media to record and download
-bootstrap for styling, with inline styling
-also used a slow scroll npm so everything is on a single page with a click of a button it scrolls down.
-also if you click on the outside white lines it goes back up to the top "feature"
- used react-router-dom
